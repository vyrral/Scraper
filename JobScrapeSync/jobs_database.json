    "title": "Fruit Picking and Packing Jobs in USA for Foreigners",
    "company": "Reputable Company",
    "location": "USA, United States, Canada",
    "description": "- Full Time - USA, United States Reputable Company For foreigners seeking seasonal employment in the USA, fruit picking and packing roles offer lucrative opportunities, especially in states like California, Washington, and Florida during peak harvest seasons. These positions are in high demand due to the agricultural prowess of these regions. We are looking to hire an energetic picker to assist us in preparing orders for shipping. The picker will utilize requisitions and order sheets to pick a wide variety of items, place and arrange items in containers and bins following specific instructions, and arrange containers on pallets. To be successful as a packer you must have attention to detail and the ability to organize items. A good packer is efficient and careful not to damage items. Fruit Picker & Packer Jobs in UK with Visa Sponsorship for Foreigners Understanding Work Opportunities for Foreigners Visa Requirements: The most common visa for seasonal agricultural work is the H-2A visa. This program allows U.S. employers to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs. Eligibility: For fruit picking and packing roles, foreigners require a valid H-2A visa sponsored by employers facing difficulty in finding sufficient domestic workers to meet seasonal demands. Finding Fruit Picking and Packing Jobs Job Portals and Websites: Websites like USA Farm Labor, Inc. and PickYourOwn.org frequently advertise available positions. Additionally, specialized agricultural employment agencies focusing on seasonal work may also feature opportunities. Direct Contact with Farms: Some farms may advertise directly on their websites or through local agricultural networks. Contacting farms directly can sometimes yield opportunities. Recruitment Agencies: Agencies specializing in agricultural employment can be a crucial resource, especially for securing H-2A sponsorship. Application Process Securing a Sponsor: First, find an H-2A approved employer willing to sponsor your visa. Visa Application: Once you’ve secured a sponsor, the next step is to apply for an H-2A visa. This process entails submitting required documents and attending an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate in your home country. Travel Arrangements: Upon approval, you will coordinate with your employer about travel arrangements to the U.S. Working Conditions Contract Length: The duration of H-2A employment can vary but is usually for the length of a specific harvest or planting season. Wages: Employers are required to pay a wage that matches or exceeds the highest of three criteria: the prevailing wage for the crop or region, the applicable state or federal minimum wage, or the wage paid to other employees performing equivalent roles. Housing and Transportation: In general, employers are obligated to furnish free housing for H-2A workers who cannot feasibly return home daily. Additionally, they typically cover or reimburse transportation expenses between the worker’s home country and the job site. FAQs - Are these jobs available year-round? - Fruit picking jobs are generally seasonal, with peak times varying by location and type of crop. - Can I bring my family with me on an H-2A visa? - No, H-2A visas do not allow for dependents or family members to accompany the visa holder. - What happens if I am not offered employment after arriving in the U.S.? - Your stay in the U.S. is dependent on your employment status. If your employment ends, you generally must return to your home country. Summary of Fruit Picking and Packing Jobs in USA Fruit picking and packing jobs in the USA offer foreigners a chance to earn money and experience American agriculture firsthand. However, navigating the H-2A visa process and securing employment with a certified sponsor is essential for success.",

    "description": "Our business opportunity is significant; we can deliver both infrastructure and business applications to the enterprise market. As companies refresh their data centers, our goal is to be the platform for cloud and apps. As they re-architect their business applications to embrace open source, our goal is to deliver the majority of their databases, analytics, messaging, publishing, identity, security, workflow... everything that is open source. We are committed to do that at the most efficient price points possible to drive down the total cost of IT, but this is nevertheless a significant global market, and our ambition is to be counted among the most valued software suppliers to the Global 10, 000. The company is founder led, profitable and growing. We are hiring a Chief Revenue Officer, to lead our enterprise sales, sales development, partner, channel, alliance, customer success and field engineering teams. This position will report to the CEO and collaborate with the most senior leaders of Canonical to drive sustainable growth. Success in this role depends on both operational and inspirational leadership. We see the role as program, process and metric oriented, with leadership and charisma being necessary but not sufficient. It is not itself a sales position so much as one that demands astute planning and tactical operations combined with leadership, rigor and insight into the global dynamics and drivers of enterprise software selection and procurement today. Perhaps unusually we are looking for a leader who is insightful and passionate about the impact of open source in the world. Across every category of compute - from the very lowest-level microcontroller to the fastest CPU's and GPUs, from the biggest cloud infrastructure to the tiniest devices, we see open source growing in both share and reputation. The same is true in every category of business and scientific application. Our opportunity is to deliver the majority of that software globally. Our mission is to do that efficiently, at low cost, in a way that accelerates progress and preserves a level playing field in silicon and cloud. We work closely with both silicon and cloud providers to maximise performance and align with their differentiated offerings. We work to build and sustain trust as the best way for their customers to get the widest range of open source, and the best of their infrastructure and compute capability. As a result, we are growing mind share and market share. This is a tremendous responsibility, but it is also an extraordinary value proposition. As Chief Revenue Officer you will be accountable for: - Go-to-market strategy - prioritize sectors and markets, identify organisational gaps and lead hiring to close them - Planning - challenge individual teams to develop appropriate, ambitious but sustainable execution plans and metrics with cascading goals and targets - Execution - review relevant data and correct course where needed on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis - Sponsorship - support leaders to close large ($10M+ ARR) deals with global-10k enterprises and large, complex, global tech sector partners - Insight - capture and share patterns, issues, and insights from customers and partners to broaden commercial awareness within Canonical - Staffing - supervise the Canonical recruitment, selection and onboarding processes in your organisation - Productivity - design and lead career and skills development together with continuous improvement in your organisation - Culture - select for, and invest in, transparent communications, accountability trust, and the work ethic needed for success - Inspirational leadership - demonstrate and cultivate passion for Canonical's mission, for customers and the market Direct enterprise sales The VP Enterprise Sales will report to the CRO. - Set high expectations of sales ability, readiness, performance and results - Hire sales leaders, and set expectations for hiring effectiveness and results in the org - Work with sales leaders to build annual targets and plans by region, sector and product - Ensure accurate reporting and status on prospects and opportunities - Review progress, metrics and results on a weekly, monthly and quarterly basis - Lead for high quality customer engagement and commitment to customer delight Our VP Alliances will report to the CRO. This lead drives our strategy and execution in regard to: - ISVs who embed Ubuntu and Canonical open source - IHVs (Dell, HP, Lenovo etc) who certify and preinstall Ubuntu and deliver solutions - Silicon providers (Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Mediatek etc) who optimise open source for their new offerings - Cloud partners and customers who build ecosystems, products and communities based on Ubuntu - VAR, GSI and distribution partnerships Currently, sector GTM leads report to the VP Alliances, but the overall sector strategy and execution will be a CRO responsibility and the organisation structure will be determined by them.
